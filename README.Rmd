The goal of isotroph is to provide a set of tools to infer trophic metrics from isotopic values.
The first one is the dynamic mixing model (dmm) applied to estimate the diet of animals by using isotope signatures of an individual.

# Dynamic mixing model (dmm)
## load data
## run the model and functions
## produce figures and results

%What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub.
