# Isotroph description
Isotroph is a repository containing modelling tools for using stable isotopes in trophic ecology.

The goal of isotroph is to provide a set of tools to infer trophic metrics from isotopic values.
The first one is the dynamic mixing model (dmm) applied to estimate the diet of animals by using isotope signatures of an individual and its food sources.


Isotroph includes all the isotope-based tools developed during my PhD thesis. The first sub-repository is named dmm and presents the development and the application of a dynamic mixing model at the individual scale. The dmm is detailed here: [dmm documentation](isotroph/dmm/dmm-readme.html).
